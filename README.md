This application has been built with Python and MySQL. It allows users to buys products (e.g. microphones) for events such as concerts. One event can have many products. A service fee exists separately for each product and event. The fee is optional for a product, but mandatory for an event. If the product fee is zero, the event fee applies. Given an event, and a list of products and quantities, this program returns the total cost to the user. A command-line user interface has been provided. 

To run application, open a terminal and type 'python event_products_app.py'. Valid data can be viewed in the 'SQL_schema' file.
